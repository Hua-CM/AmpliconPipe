# AmpliconPipe

An standard amplicon standard analysis workflow provides basic analyses for quickly understanding data conditions. It includes both upstream and downstream scripts.

`Standard`: Analysis pipeline for normal 16S/ITS amplicon sequencing analysis

## Dependency

software

- `usearch`
- `qiime2`

R packages

- `tidyverse`
- `microeco`
- `magrittr`
- `patchwork`

## TODO

1. Analysis pipeline for absolute quantification of amplicon sequencing process.
2. Analysis pipeline for synthetic microbial community (SynCom) experiments (i.e., the process of specifying a local species library).
